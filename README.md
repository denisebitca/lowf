# lowf (frontend)
The website for low-effort one-on-one chatting: be anyone at anytime!

## Attention

**I am currently documenting and cleaning up the lowf codebase. If you want to see lowf in action, you can either go on https://lowf.codes or https://projects.rafaelbitca.me/lowf (first one is being run off my local server, second one is being run off a DigitalOcean droplet). If you want to run lowf by yourself, you will have to give me a moment, as I finish splitting the front and the backend.**

## Building lowf from source

**Building only works on Unix based systems!**

```bash
npm run build
```

The whole website will be in the dist folder.

## TODOs
### Advertising spaces

I'm not exactly sure how much money it costs me to run lowf off my home server (I'll see if we have to pay more in electricity costs this month), but eventually I would like for the website to sustain itself if I have to run it off a home server. Therefore, I plan to add advertisement spots on the page.
